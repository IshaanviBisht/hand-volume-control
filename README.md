# ✋ Hand Gesture Volume Control with OpenCV

Control your Mac's volume using just your fingers!
This Python project uses your webcam to track your **thumb and index finger**, and adjusts the volume based on how far apart they are.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Uses a webcam and OpenCV to capture your hand.
- Tracks hand landmarks using a pre-built module (`HandTrackingModule.py`).
- Calculates the distance between your thumb and index finger.
- Changes system volume accordingly.
- Also shows a visual volume bar and some vibrant circles/lines for extra flair ✨

## Note: 

This project works only on macOS because it uses AppleScript (osascript) for volume control.
